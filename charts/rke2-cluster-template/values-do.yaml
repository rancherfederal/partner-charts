  # specify rolling update mechanism
  # rollingUpdate:
  #   The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.
  #   Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired
  #   machines (ex: 10%).
  #   Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
  #   This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
  #   Defaults to 0.
  #   Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
  #   down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
  #   starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
  #   down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
  #   that the total number of machines available at all times
  #   during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.
  #   maxUnavailable: "5"
  #   The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the
  #   desired number of machines.
  #   Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of
  #   desired machines (ex: 10%).
  #   This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
  #   Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
  #   Defaults to 1.
  #   Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
  #   up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total
  #   number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired
  #   machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
  #   be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
  #   at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.
  #   maxSurge: "1"
